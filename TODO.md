# TODO list:
 - [ ] Add counting logic to back - now it just don't count total salary, just sums salaries that was ever assigned (not even payrates are counted). Fully redo annual report, including front referencing
 - [ ] Add some letter generation (?) for employees if their monthly income is 0
 - [ ] Add some sort of testing (maybe some script that will do some api queries and check results)
 - [ ] Add list of positions that are available generation printing
 - [x] Fix autocomplete: hints are not closing and overlapping
 - [x] Add employee firing logic
 - [x] Split frontend to script and style files
 - [x] Add firing logic - now employees can quit from contracts and positions
